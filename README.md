# Description
This assignment on sampling for UCS654 involves gathering a dataset regarding credit cards, a binary classification problem. The dataset is imbalanced and hence it is balanced by using random over-sampling. After balancing the dataset, different sampling techniques are used and five different models are applied to get the accuracy on the testing set. The dataset is divided into a 25-75 ratio of testing and training set.


The sampling techniques used include simple random sampling, stratified sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling, and multi-stage sampling. Simple random sampling is where members of the subset have an equal probability of being chosen. Stratified sampling involves the division of a population into smaller subgroups known as strata. Systematic sampling is when members of the population are selected at a regular interval. Cluster sampling is where a population is divided into clusters and then randomly selecting some of these clusters as a sample. Multi-stage sampling is a combination of sampling techniques, such as cluster and simple random sampling.
